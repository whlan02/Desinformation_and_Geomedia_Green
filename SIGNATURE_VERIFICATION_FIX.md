# Signature Verification Fix Applied

## Issue Identified
The signature verification was failing (returning `false`) even though the backend responded with status 200. This was due to a **hash processing mismatch** between the mobile app and backend.

## Root Cause
1. **Backend hash creation**: Creates SHA-512 hash as HEX string: `crypto.createHash('sha512').update(combinedData).digest('hex')`
2. **Mobile app signing**: Was incorrectly treating HEX string as UTF-8: `new TextEncoder().encode(processResult.hashToSign!)`
3. **Backend verification**: Was also incorrectly treating HEX string as UTF-8: `new TextEncoder().encode(hash)`

This meant the mobile app and backend were signing/verifying completely different byte arrays!

## Fix Applied

### Mobile App (camera.tsx)
**Before:**
```javascript
const hashBytes = new TextEncoder().encode(processResult.hashToSign!);
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Convert HEX hash string to bytes (same as secp256k1Utils.ts)
const hashBytes = new Uint8Array(
  processResult.hashToSign!.match(/.{1,2}/g)!.map(byte => parseInt(byte, 16))
);
```

### Backend (steganography-service.js)
**Before:**
```javascript
// Convert hash to bytes for verification (same as app signing)
const hashBytes = new TextEncoder().encode(hash);
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Convert HEX hash string to bytes (same as mobile app signing)
const hashBytes = new Uint8Array(
  hash.match(/.{1,2}/g).map(byte => parseInt(byte, 16))
);
```

## Files Modified
1. `/geoCamApp/app/camera.tsx` - Fixed mobile app hash processing before signing
2. `/Web_Backend/steganography-service.js` - Fixed both `verifySignature()` and `verifyRGBASignature()` methods

## Expected Result
- Signature verification should now return `valid: true` for properly signed images
- The complete cryptographic chain is now consistent:
  1. Backend creates SHA-512 hash as HEX
  2. Mobile app converts HEX to bytes and signs with secp256k1
  3. Backend converts HEX to bytes and verifies with secp256k1

## Testing Status
- âœ… Backend services restarted with fixes
- âœ… Expo app restarted with fixes
- ðŸ”„ Ready for end-to-end signature verification testing

## Next Steps
1. Capture a new image with the fixed signing process
2. Verify the image to confirm signature validation returns `true`
3. Validate complete cryptographic authenticity workflow
