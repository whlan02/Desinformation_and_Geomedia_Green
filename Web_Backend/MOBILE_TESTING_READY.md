- SHA-512 image hashing
- Production-grade signature verification
- Coincurve library for crypto operations

#### ✅ API Security
- Comprehensive input validation
- Format validation for signatures and keys
- Timestamp validation for replay protection
- Security logging and monitoring

#### ✅ Database Security
- Only public keys stored in database
- All verification attempts logged

- Complete audit trail

### 📲 Mobile App Testing Instructions

#### Step 1: Connect Your Device
1. **Scan the QR Code** displayed in the terminal
2. **Open the GeoCam app** on your device
3. **Ensure device is connected** to the same network

#### Step 2: Test Device Registration
1. **Launch the app** for the first time
2. **Allow camera permissions** when prompted
3. **Verify device registration** succeeds
4. **Check backend logs** for registration confirmation

#### Step 3: Test Image Capture and Verification
1. **Take a photo** using the app's camera
2. **Verify image signing** happens locally
3. **Submit for verification** to the backend
4. **Check verification results** in the app

#### Step 4: Test Security Features
1. **Verify private key protection**: Keys never leave device
2. **Check signature creation**: Happens locally only
3. **Test backend verification**: Uses public keys only
4. **Monitor security logs**: All checks logged

#### Step 5: Test End-to-End Flow
1. **Complete image capture workflow**
2. **Verify signature validation**
3. **Check device listing** in backend
4. **Review verification statistics**
